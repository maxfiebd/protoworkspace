This directory exists for testing out new design approaches.

Some of the things we want to do are not straightforward,
so this directory allows for experimentation in isolation.

Guidelines for contributing:

Each design question should have its own subdirectory
and should be associated with a GitHub issue or decision
tracked in the docs/decisions folder.

Create a separate PR to delete your subdirectory after the code has been incorporated into the main project and the design decisions have been documented
